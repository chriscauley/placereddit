* remove placereddit.db from git (oops)
* /r/<reddit>/
** should be a static page using relative images
** /r/monkeyturdisnotasubreddit/ should show reddit's 404 images
* /r/featured/ and /r/random/ should give redirects to a featured subreddit and a random subreddit
* need to clean out images directory once in a while
* may need to spider reddit.com to avoid nsfw images in sfw reddits!
* check to make sure file system cache is clearing out (maybe delete along with other deletion script?)
